APPLICATION=db_MySQLi Class

v0.2.4:

12-Nov-2016 - Renamed base class to db_mysqli.class.php. Required
              as my own framework autoloads PHP classes by using
              "classname.class.php" as searchpattern.

18-Oct-2016 - Added default variable $row to FetchResult() to avoid
              PHP warnings

v0.2.3:

14-Sep-2016 - Fixed Return code of QueryHash() in case of an error.
              If an integer error is returned from Execute() we pass
              this back, else we just return TRUE.
              Also enhanced error handling in Execute(), QueryHash()
              and QueryResultHash() to always return correct error message.

            - QueryHash() now also checks if return value from Execute()
              is an instance of mysqli_result instead of checking for
              boolean value.

v0.2.2:

12-Apr-2016 - Fixed exception in FetchResult() if wrong type of variable
              is given to mysqli_stmt_result_metadata(). Now the type is
              checked before calling this function.

v0.2.1:

28-Mar-2016 - Changed example "test_queryresulthash.php" to auto-create the
              test table "MYSQLI_DB_TEST_QUERIES", populate it with data
              and drop it automatically at the end of the test.

07-Mar-2016 - Added new method:

              * QueryResultHash()

              This method allows to use bind vars when fetching resultset
              data from MySQL. The FetchResult() method was enhanced to have
              a single fetch method for both QueryResult() and QueryResultHash()

            - Added new example "test_queryresulthash.php" to demonstrate
              the usage of the new method.

            - Fixed the example "test_bind_vars.php".

V0.2.0:

08-Jan-2015 - Made GetErrorText() & GetErrno() aware of Statement errors:
              if Prepare() failed the internal class error variables are set
              and utilized in both GetErr*() methods.


06-Jan-2015 - Changed format of bind vars, now you just have to pass in the
              following format:
                                [<VAL>,<TYPE>]

              <VAL>   => The value to add
              <TYPE>  => Variable type, see DBOF_TYPE_* types or
                         look in the php.net manual.

10-Dec-2015 - Added new example test_bind_vars.php which tests the new methods
              related to binding params and result sets including a small benchmark
              to compare bind-vars vs. static queries

            - Added new methods:
              * Prepare()
              * Execute()

            - Rewritten QueryHash() to utilize Prepare() and Execute() methods.

07-Dec-2015 - Added Bindvar support, currently only QueryHash() method is implemented.

            - Reworked all examples and documentation

V0.1.3:

09-Jan-2014 - Public release as v0.1.3.

            - Finished documentation.

05-Jan-2014 - Updated documentation and added missing README to release as 0.1.3

            - Added method "GetPConnect()" to retrieve persistant connection flag.

V0.1.2:

28-Sep-2014 - Removed all remaining references to MYSQL inside the documentation.

V0.1.1:

01-Sep-2014 - Renamed "EnableCompatibleMode()" to "SetCompatMode()" and added
              missing defines for MYSQL_ASSOC, MYSQL_BOTH and MYSQL_NUM

24-Aug-2014 - Added all examples from MySQL() class, also added new tests.

            - Added new methods:
              * Set_CharSet()
              * Get_CharSet()
              * EnableCompatibleMode()
              * DescTable()
              * GetErrorHandling()
              * AffectedRows()
              * NumRows()
              * PerformNewInsert()
              * SetPConnect()

            - Changed constructor method, now it is defined as __construct(),
              also changed all class variables and constants.

            - During PHP's decision to drop the mysql extension in favour of
              the mysqli class, it was necessary to complete this class as
              a replacement for my old mysql class. This in turn requires
              renaming of all defines to match the old class. Also code
              from old class ported to this class to make it usable as if
              it was the old class.
