APPLICATION=db_MySQLi Class

V0.2.0:

08-Jan-2015 - Made GetErrorText() & GetErrno() aware of Statement errors:
              if Prepare() failed the internal class error variables are set
              and utilized in both GetErr*() methods.


06-Jan-2015 - Changed format of bind vars, now you just have to pass in the
              following format:
                                [<VAL>,<TYPE>]

              <VAL>   => The value to add
              <TYPE>  => Variable type, see DBOF_TYPE_* types or
                         look in the php.net manual.

10-Dec-2015 - Added new example test_bind_vars.php which tests the new methods
              related to binding params and result sets including a small benchmark
              to compare bind-vars vs. static queries

            - Added new methods:
              * Prepare()
              * Execute()

            - Rewritten QueryHash() to utilize Prepare() and Execute() methods.

            - Reworked all examples and documentation

              missing defines for MYSQL_ASSOC, MYSQL_BOTH and MYSQL_NUM

            - Added new methods:

            - Changed constructor method, now it is defined as __construct(),
              also changed all class variables and constants.

            - During PHP's decision to drop the mysql extension in favour of
              the mysqli class, it was necessary to complete this class as
              a replacement for my old mysql class. This in turn requires
              renaming of all defines to match the old class. Also code
              from old class ported to this class to make it usable as if
              it was the old class.
