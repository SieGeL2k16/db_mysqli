1. INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class is used as 1:1 replacement for my old db_mysql class, which will
stop functioning in the near future, as the PHP devs decided to drop the
"mysql" extension.
This class uses the "mysqli" (MySQL improved) extension and has all methods
the db_MySQL class also provides.


2. REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use this class you have to met the following requirements:

- PHP 5.x with enabled "mysqli" extension. Tested with 5.6.4.

- MySQL Database, version should not matter. Tested with 5.x


3. INSTALLATION AND USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy the supplied mysqlidb_class.php to a directory of your choice, a good
place would be the inc/ directory of your project. Also copy the file
dbdefs.inc.php to the same directory you have copied the mysqlidb_class.php
file.

The file "dbdefs.inc.php" serves as the configuration file for the class.
You may give an alternate path to this file in the constructor of this class.

The following defines can be set to use the class inside dbdefs.inc.php:

MYSQLDB_HOST            - Hostname or IP address of target database.

MYSQLDB_PORT            - Opt. Portnumber of target DB, defaults to 3306.

MYSQLDB_USER            - MySQL Username used as default connection.

MYSQLDB_PASS            - MySQL Password for useraccount above.

MYSQLDB_DATABASE        - The schema name to use.

MYSQLAPPNAME            - Name of your application. This is used in error
                          messages.

DB_ERRORMODE            - How errors should be handled. Default is to show
                          only limited informations for safety reasons. See
                          description of setErrorHandling() for further
                          details.

MYSQLDB_ADMINEMAIL      - Specify an email address to be used whenever an
                          error occures. This email is shown in error messages
                          and if MYSQLDB_SENTMAILONERROR is set also used to
                          sent out an automatic mail to that address in case
                          of an error.

MYSQLDB_SENTMAILONERROR - Flag indicating if the class should auto-send emails
                          to the defined EMail address whenever an error
                          occures. Set it to 1 to enable auto-sending, and set
                          it to 0 to disable this behavour.

MYSQLDB_MAIL_EXTRAARGS  - Use this define to pass additional parameter to the
                          mail() command in SendmailOnError(). Some servers
                          might need to set the -f parameter when using PHP's
                          mail() command, and to allow this also here in the
                          class you can use this define. Default is unset.

MYSQLDB_USE_PCONNECT    - if set to 1 persistant connections are used,
                          else standard connects are used. This can be set
                          also on a script-by-script basis via the method
                          setPConnect().

MYSQLDB_CHARACTERSET    - You can set here the character set the class should
                          set to MySQL during the connect phase. This allows
                          to set the MySQL communication i.e. to 'utf8'.
                          If this define is not set the default character set
                          of MySQL is used.

MYSQLDB_TIME_NAMES      - You can set here the default language used for date
                          and time translations. Specify here the values as
                          listed under the following url:
                          http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/locale-support.html
                          If this define is not set the default language of the
                          MySQL Server is used.

MYSQLDB_COMPATIBLE_MODE - If you are using this class as replacement for my
                          old "db_MySQL" class, enable this switch and set it
                          to TRUE. The class will simulate the old class and
                          auto-define all required defines so that you need to
                          change only  the Constructor call, everything else
                          should work out-of-the-box. New projects should never
                          use this and leave it to the default value of FALSE.

The file dbdefs.inc.php is automatically require()d by the class once you
instantiate it the first time.

To use the class you have to require() the class code, the rest is done
automatically when you first instantiate the class. Normally you may have one
PHP script which includes several others, here would be the ideal place to put
the require() statement for the class, i.e.:

---[SNIP]---

// ...Your require() statements

require("path/to/mysqlidb_class.php");

// ..Rest of your code here

---[SNIP]---

Once this is done and you have added the proper values in dbdefs.inc.php you
can now start using the class, this would look like this for example:

---[SNIP]---

<?php
require("mysqlidb_class.php");

$db = new db_MySQLi;
$db->Connect();
$mver = $db->Version();
$db->Disconnect();
echo("Your MySQL Server is V".$mver);
?>

---[SNAP]---

As you can see in this example the dbdefs.inc.php file is automatically loaded
when you create the first instance of the db_MySQLi object.
You can also use a different configfile by specifying a different path to
your config inside the constructor, like this:

---[SNIP]---

<?php
require("mysqlidb_class.php");

$db = new db_MySQLi('/path/to/my/own/config.inc.php');
$db->Connect();
$mver = $db->Version();
$db->Disconnect();
echo("Your MySQL Server is V".$mver);
?>

---[SNAP]---

6. FINAL WORDS AND CONTACT ADDRESSES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm using this class now in several projects and never encountered any
problems. However we all know that no software is 100% bugfree, so if you
have found a bug or have suggestions or feature requests feel free to contact
me on the following URL: http://www.saschapfalz.de/contact.php.

Happy coding!
